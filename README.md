# Web Application Intrusion Detection System - WAIDS
### Overview
The purpose of the WAIDS was based on the analysis to design an Intrusion Detection System and to create an Administration panel for further analyzing and system administration. In this work we deal with the web traffic monitoring and with the processing and scanning HTTP requests for the security reasons. The main purpose of the request scanning is to detect a possible malicious payload input by the user. The final system is composed of two main parts, these are the agent for the packet sniffing and sending user requests to the IDS, and the admin IDS panel for system administration, REGEX rule management and traffic analysis.
